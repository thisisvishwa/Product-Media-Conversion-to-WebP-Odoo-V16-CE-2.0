# Troubleshooting Guide for Product Media Conversion to WebP Module

## Introduction
This guide aims to help users and administrators troubleshoot common issues that may arise while using the Product Media Conversion to WebP Module for Odoo Version 16 Community Edition.

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Image Conversion Fails
**Symptoms:**
- Product images are not displayed in WebP format on the website.
- Error logs indicate failed conversion processes.

**Possible Causes:**
- Unsupported image format.
- Configuration settings are incorrect.
- Server permissions or memory issues.

**Solutions:**
- Ensure that the uploaded image is in PNG, JPEG, or JPG format.
- Review the configuration settings in the Odoo backend under the `view_res_config_settings_form_webp` to ensure they are correct.
- Check server permissions for the Odoo file system and ensure there is enough memory available for image processing.

### Issue 2: Error Logs Not Displaying
**Symptoms:**
- No error logs are visible in the dedicated error view within the Odoo Backend.

**Possible Causes:**
- Error logging feature is disabled.
- Issue with the error log view implementation.

**Solutions:**
- Check if the error logging feature is enabled in the configuration settings.
- Review the implementation of the `view_webp_conversion_error_list` to ensure it is correctly integrated.

### Issue 3: Slow Image Loading
**Symptoms:**
- Images are taking a long time to load, even after conversion to WebP.

**Possible Causes:**
- Optimization settings are not properly configured.
- Server performance issues.

**Solutions:**
